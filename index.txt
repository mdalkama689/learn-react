1. why we need react?
People realised it's harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way
There were libraries that came into the picture that made it slightly easy, but still for a very big app it's very hard (JQuery) Eventually, VueJS/React created a new syntax to do frontends
Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to HTML/CSS/JS

Problem with this approach (html counter app)

a.Too much code you have to write as the developer
b.As your app scales (todo app for eg), this gets harder and harder.



***Some react jargon***
To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things
Creator of frontend frameworks realised that all website 
can effectively be divided intp two parts

a. State    b. Components

a. State/Re-rendring
An object that represents the current state of the app
It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change)
For example, the value of the counter

** for our counter app we have state like this 
{
    counter: 1  // this is the state 
}
** In our html counter app all btns(increase, decrease and reset) is 
a component  it take state(currentCount)  as an input And is suppose 
to render accordingly.

** You usually have to define all your components once.
And then all yu have to do is update the state of your app.
React take care of re-rendring  your app.

💡 Meaning of “re-render” in React

Re-render means:
React runs your component function again to update the UI whenever
the state or props change.

🧠 In simple words:
When your data (state) changes, React refreshes the part
of the screen that depends on that data.
It doesn’t reload the whole page, only updates the necessary DOM elements.



**React is a diff calculator/engine. it calculate diffrence between old state 
and new state and update it.
** State + Components = React Website 

** When the state chnages, React updates(re-renders) the part of the page that
depends on that state. Re-rendring means React changes the actual HTML on the screen
to match the new data/state. 

b.Components
A React component defines how a DOM element should render based 
on a given state. It is a reusable and dynamic HTML-like snippet
that automatically updates whenever the state changes.
